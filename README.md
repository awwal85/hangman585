# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it in 5 attempts.

## Aim of the Project
Theory alone is insufficient for proficiently learning code. Thus, the primary goal of this project is to provide hands-on experience while assessing my knowledge in Python.

## Experiences from the project
Through this, I have acquired skills in implementing fundamental concepts of Python and utilizing functions (also referred to as methods within a class) to create user-friendly objects.

This project has enhanced my comprehension of Github. The seamless collaboration between the repository and VS Code has been an invaluable and fulfilling learning experience.
